# Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

## About Me
I'm Shivam Tyagi, a Data Scientist and Master's student at Vanderbilt University. My work bridges data science and finance, and I'm on a mission to transform data into actionable insights, enhance decision-making, and push the boundaries of innovation in tech and finance.

## 🌐 Current Focus
🔭 **Projects**:  
- Exploring advanced data science applications in finance, such as asset pricing models and trading algorithms.
- Investigating world knowledge representation in large language models, focusing on MLP layers and fine-tuning techniques (PEFT with LoRA).

🌱 **Learning**:  
- Enhancing my understanding of multimodal models and deep learning architectures, especially transformer-based models, as I explore new areas like Rotary Positional Encoding and light curve data analysis.

## 💬 Ask Me About
- **Data Science in Finance**: Whether it's quantitative modeling, asset pricing, or algorithmic trading, I’m always up for discussing impactful applications.
- **Technical Foundations**: I enjoy talking about linear transformations, vector algebra, probability theory, and advanced statistics.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Let’s chat about the technical aspects of machine learning models, especially those involving transformers and representation learning.

## 🔍 What Drives Me
Data science gives me the opportunity to make meaningful, data-driven decisions, potentially building wealth without reliance on the traditional paycheck system. I am fascinated by how data science can contribute to venture capital and private equity, and I aspire to make a lasting impact in this space.
