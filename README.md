## Who am I?
Someone with curiosity and a desire to contribute to the world through skills and push personal limits.<br>

#

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects that widen my horizon and help me become a part of the data science community.<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning algorithms in a much deeper level to leverage all that I can with models I create. (Check out my from scratch repositories)<br>
ðŸ’¬ talk to me about linear transformations, vector algebra, probability and statistics. I am always ready to learn something new.<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I want to write articles and post videos about data science, I am not sure how and when, but stay tuned maybe you might stumble on one of my creations.<br>
