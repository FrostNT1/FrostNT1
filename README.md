# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my Github profile.

## Who am I?
Hi, I am Shivam Tyagi, a second year student in NSUT Delhi.<br>
A person with natural curiosity and a drive to help those around me.<br>
I want to help the world by utilising my skills and push the limits of what is currently possible.

#

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects that widen my horizon and help me become a bigger part of the data science community.<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning algorithms in a much deeper level to leverage all that I can with models I create. (Check out my from scratch repositories)<br>
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about linear transformations, vector algebra, probabilty and statistics and we will have an interesting conversation that makes you wish time ran slower.<br>
âš¡ Fun fact: I really want to write articles and post videos about data science, I am not sure how and when, but stay tuned maybe you might stumble on one of my creations.<br>
